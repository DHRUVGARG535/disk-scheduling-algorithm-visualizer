        <h1>Learn About Disk Scheduling Algorithms</h1>

        <h2>What is Disk Scheduling?</h2>
        <p>
            Disk scheduling is the process of deciding the order in which disk I/O (input/output) requests are processed by the disk controller. 
            The goal is to minimize the seek time (the time taken by the disk head to move to the desired track) and improve the overall performance 
            of the disk system. Different algorithms achieve this in various ways, balancing efficiency, fairness, and complexity.
        </p>

        <h2>1. FCFS (First Come First Serve)</h2>
        <p>
            FCFS is the simplest disk scheduling algorithm. It processes requests in the order they arrive in the queue.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The disk head moves to each request in the sequence they were received.</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Easy to implement and fair, as it serves requests in order.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Can result in high seek times if requests are far apart, leading to inefficient head movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> If the head is at 53 and requests are [98, 183, 37, 122], the head moves 53 → 98 → 183 → 37 → 122, causing large seek times.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)</h2>
        <p>
            SSTF selects the request closest to the current head position, minimizing the seek time for each step.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> From the current head position, the algorithm picks the nearest request, moves the head there, and repeats until all requests are processed.</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Reduces seek time compared to FCFS by prioritizing nearby requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Can cause starvation for requests far from the head if new nearby requests keep arriving.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> For head at 53 and requests [98, 183, 37, 122], SSTF might process 53 → 37 → 98 → 122 → 183, minimizing total head movement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. SCAN (Elevator Algorithm)</h2>
        <p>
            SCAN moves the disk head in one direction (e.g., toward higher or lower tracks) until it reaches the end, then reverses direction, servicing requests along the way.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The head moves in one direction, servicing all requests in that direction, then reverses and services the remaining requests.</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> More efficient than FCFS and prevents starvation by ensuring all requests are eventually serviced.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Requests at the extremes may experience longer wait times.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> For head at 53 moving toward higher tracks with requests [98, 183, 37, 122], the head moves 53 → 98 → 122 → 183, then reverses to 37.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. C-SCAN (Circular SCAN)</h2>
        <p>
            C-SCAN is similar to SCAN but only services requests in one direction. After reaching the end, the head jumps to the opposite end and starts again.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> The head moves in one direction (e.g., increasing tracks), services requests, jumps to the start (e.g., track 0), and repeats in the same direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Provides more uniform wait times compared to SCAN, as it treats the disk as a circular structure.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Slightly higher seek times due to the jump from one end to the other.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> For head at 53 with requests [98, 183, 37, 122], the head moves 53 → 98 → 122 → 183 → (disk end) → 0 → 37.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. LOOK</h2>
        <p>
            LOOK is a variation of SCAN where the head only moves as far as the farthest request in the current direction, instead of going to the disk's end.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>How it works:</strong> Similar to SCAN, but the head reverses direction when there are no more requests in the current direction, avoiding unnecessary movement.</li>
            <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> More efficient than SCAN by reducing unnecessary head movement to the disk's end.</li>
            <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Still has longer wait times for requests at the extremes, like SCAN.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> For head at 53 with requests [98, 183, 37, 122], the head moves 53 → 98 → 122 → 183, then reverses to 37, without going to the disk's end.</li>
        </ul>
